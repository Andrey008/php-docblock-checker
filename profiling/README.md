# Profiling

Generate a profile by running `profile.sh`. This will run the docchecker against its own code.

Once complete, the script will run `xh-tool` to show the top 5 functions.

You can dig deeper into the profile using `xh-tool` (Located in `vendor/bin/xh-tool`)

More information on `xh-tool` is at https://github.com/phperf/xh-tool#usage
